This repo contains examples written in functional programming style. Programs can be written in this style in any 
language. This repo uses scala as its languge.
 
 
1. BasicLoop: A basic 'for' loop has mutable state. This example shows how do do a basic loop in a functional 
   way so as to avoid any mutable state. 
   
2. FoldLeft: This is a very versatile method. I put together some examples using foldLeft in here to show case its 
   versatility. Comes in very handy when you have a loop in mind.

3. NestedLoops: Some examples which are usually written with nested loops in imperative style but are now 
   written in a functional way.
